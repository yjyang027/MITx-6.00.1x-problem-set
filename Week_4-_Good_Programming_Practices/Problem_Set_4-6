# Problem 6 - Playing a Game
# 15/15 points (graded)
# A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code
# that implements the playGame function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the playGame body. Read through the
# specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to
# determine the number of cards in a hand.

# Testing: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. Try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program, and be
# sure that you can play the wordgame with different hand sizes by modifying only the variable HAND_SIZE.

def playGame(wordList):
    hand = {}
    while True: 
          order = input ('Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: ')
          if order == 'n':
                   hand = dealHand (HAND_SIZE)
                   playHand(hand, wordList, HAND_SIZE)
                   continue
          elif order == 'r':
                   if hand != {}:
                         hand_r = hand
                         playHand(hand_r, wordList, HAND_SIZE)
                   else:
                       print ('You have not played a hand yet. Please play a new hand first!')
          elif order == 'e':
                   
                   break
          else:
                   print ('Invalid command.')
                   continue
