# Problem 5 - Playing a Hand
# 10/10 points (graded)
# In ps4a.py, note that in the function playHand, there is a bunch of pseudocode. This pseudocode is provided to help guide you in
# writing your function. Check out the Why Pseudocode? resource to learn more about the What and Why of Pseudocode before you start
# coding your solution.

# Note: Do not assume that there will always be 7 letters in a hand! The parameter n represents the size of the hand.

# Testing: Before testing your code in the answer box, try out your implementation as if you were playing the game.
