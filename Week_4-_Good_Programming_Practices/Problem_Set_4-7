# Problem 7 - You and your Computer
# 20/20 points (graded)
# Now that your computer can choose a word, you need to give the computer the option to play. Write the code that re-implements the
# playGame function. You will modify the function to behave as described below in the function's comments. As before, you should use the
# HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand. Be sure to try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program.
