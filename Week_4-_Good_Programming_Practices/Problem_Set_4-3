# Problem 3 - Valid Words
# 10/10 points (graded)
# At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. We can also ask the user for a word
# (Python's input) and score the word (using your getWordScore). However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a
# word given by a player obeys the rules of the game. A valid word is in the word list; and it is composed entirely of letters from the
# current hand. Implement the isValidWord function.

# Testing: Make sure the test_isValidWord tests pass. In addition, you will want to test your implementation by calling it multiple times
# on the same hand - what should the correct behavior be? Additionally, the empty string ('') is not a valid word - if you code this
# function correctly, you shouldn't need an additional check for this condition.

# Fill in the code for isValidWord in ps4a.py and be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py before pasting your
# function definition here.

    i = 0

                hand2[letter] -= 1
                i += 1
                if hand2[letter] == 0:
                    del hand2[letter]
            else:
                return False
