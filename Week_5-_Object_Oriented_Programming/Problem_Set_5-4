# Problem 4 - Decrypt a Story
# 5/5 points (graded)
# For this problem, the graders will use our implementation of the Message, PlaintextMessage, and CiphertextMessage classes, so don't worry
# if you did not get the previous parts correct.

# Now that you have all the pieces to the puzzle, please use them to decode the file story.txt. The file ps6.py contains a helper function
# get_story_string() that returns the encrypted version of the story as a string. Create a CiphertextMessage object using the story string
# and use decrypt_message to return the appropriate shift value and unencrypted story string.

def decrypt_story():
    text = get_story_string()
    obj = CiphertextMessage(text)
    return obj.decrypt_message()
